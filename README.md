# Spotify Wrapped Resume

## Transformed my resume into a Spotify Wrapped format by utilizing HTML/CSS and integrating a call to Giphy's API.

I undertook this project before an interview with Spotify to exhibit my current level of skills. Inspired by Spotify's popular theme of Wrapped, I transformed my resume into that format. It was an enjoyable project that allowed me to be more creative than my typical work. Additionally, I wanted to challenge myself by incorporating Giphy's API into the project. This project provided me with a chance to improve my skills in the following areas:

**HTML**
* Basic form input

**CSS**
* Use of custom fonts
* Use of hover effects and transitions
* Grid for the overall layout
* Combination of Grid and Flexbox for each card

**JavaScript**
* Simple DOM manipulation
* Using fetch to call Giphy's API
